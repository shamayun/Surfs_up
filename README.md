# Surfs_up
## Overview:
Potential invested wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop located in Hawaii. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. If successful, he would like to replicate similar models and expand the business in other areas.
## Results:
I have utilized Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQLAlchemy to analyze, manipulate data, Matplotlib to visualize outcomes, and Flask to share findings with other poetential stakeholders who are interested to invest in the surf shop business.
### three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)
* June data count(1,700) is more than December data count(1,517), June average temperature(74) is higher than December average temperature(71.04). Even though the mean difference is only ~4 degrees, more count in June data lowered the mean significantly. June is definitely the weather for surfing and ice-cream.
* Temperatures in June is more consistent, clustered around the mean. December temperatures have slightly higher standard deviation, indicate data are more spread out.
* December also has colder days compared to June, where minimum temperature can be as low as 56 degrees. June minimum is 64 degrees, a gap of 8 degrees.

Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are 
* two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
